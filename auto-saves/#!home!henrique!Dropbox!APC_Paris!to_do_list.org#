#+STARTUP: showall hidestars

* TODO 


*** DONE Edit paper and submit

*** DONE Write the email for the seminar

*** TODO Reply Melissa 

*** TODO Call fermilab

** LArSoft
   - Understand PD simulation file
   - Make sync between larsoft and data for CRT

** SuperCell
   - Finish Weiner-like filter. I can use the noise from run 99 (20220201). 
   - (w or w/o the filter) Make the convolution in each waveform
   - Apply filter to the fft in the waveform bases.

   - Update: actually Wiener filter is on the way. I need to check now about smaller waveforms. What if I fill with zeros? My solution was decreasing the FFT resolution. Let's see how it goes.. 

   - note: noise spectrum analyzed without filter, resulting std dev = 6.7 


** Coldbox 
   - June data:
     + [ ] Signal from Ch3 and Ch4 (MiniArapuca A4ch1 and A1ch2) have a weird shape and noise is present.
     + [ ] Both cathode on and off showed this problem.
       + Example Run2 (off) 91 and 92
       + Example Run2 (on) 91 and 92
     + [ ] Ch3 example of high dark count: events 68, 69)

   - CRP had grounding problems in april. -> Ask Sabrina if we can have a special ground here
   - In the membrane it was A6 (ACR1) and the other is "good"
   - SiPMs are alive at warm
   - No signal because pof output was 3 V (OpAmp dead af)
   - Black fiber 90 mV, 30 mV red (broken)
   - Gray fiber mV, yellow fiber 
   - Grouding of SiPMs and Tx 

   - Finding out the dark count problem. Puting the sipm and board separted. Check PMT option.
** Analog Readout
   - simulations of rise time was about 22 ns (questions about input)
   - measurements show

** Personal

** Linearity
  - Jean Pierre 

** CERN Mission

** DONE Terminate FEEEEEEEE

   
* Things to get done
  - Now saving raw
    - before: ALL 9.4 GB, LED  2.8 GB
    - After: ALL LED 7.6 GB

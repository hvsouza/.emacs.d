#+STARTUP: showall hidestars

* TODO

** LArSoft
   - Understand PD simulation file
   - Make sync between larsoft and data for CRT

** SuperCell
   - Finish Weiner-like filter. I can use the noise from run 99 (20220201). 
   - (w or w/o the filter) Make the convolution in each waveform
   - Apply filter to the fft in the waveform bases.

** Coldbox 
   - Confirmed that s.p.e. was correct

** Analog Readout
   - simulations of rise time was about 22 ns (questions about input)
   - measurements show

** Personal

** Linearity
  - Jean Pierre 

** CERN Mission

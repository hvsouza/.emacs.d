#+STARTUP: showall hidestars

* TODO
** EMACS configuration  
   - watch videos from Mike Zamansky
   - +maybe create a git repo+ 

** LArSoft
   - +Checkout Alessandra's tip to get energy+
   - +Learn to read the .root file properly+
*** Questions:
    1. What do the numbers on the vier means? (I'm assuming they correspond to trId_PandoraTrack
    2. There are a lot of events registered in the collection plane but not in the induction ones. Why so? 
    3. Where can I get the bottom electronics data? What about the data collected with CRT?
    4. +Which is TPC 0 and TPC 2 ?+
    5. +What is the "hit_channel" ? (corresponds to wires)+
    6. +trkdqdx_pandoraTrack is declared as [tracks][3][2000]. Do 3 refers to each wire planes?+ 
    7. +Related to question 4: Can I use hit_xxx to select pandora's info or are they different things?+
       example: trkdqdx_pandoraTrack[tracks][hit_plane][????] 
       Yes, hit_trkid will make the correspondence
    8. +Events 3 and 4 have example of tracks that have not be computed.+
    9. +Am I updated? How and were do I get the latest version of the processed 429 event? (make the account at ccin2p3)+


** SuperCell
   - Finish Weiner-like filter. I can use the noise from run 99 (20220201). 
   - (w or w/o the filter) Make the convolution in each waveform
   - Apply filter to the fft in the waveform bases.

** Coldbox 
   - +Make the histogram fit with two channels+
   - Plot the ffts and graphs from oscilloscope data
   - Plot the ffts and graphs from ADC data
     + reminder: offset of (C2XAra)wave0 ~ 3350 and (C1XAra)wave1 ~ 2600
   - Dante suggested to fix the ground (need to talk with him and get it better)


** Analog Readout
   - simulations of rise time was about 22 ns (questions about input)
   - measurements show

** Personal

** Linearity
  - Jean Pierre 

** CERN Mission
*** RETURN    
    - Talk with Sabrina
** DONE Expensive Sheet
** Terminate FEEEEEEEE

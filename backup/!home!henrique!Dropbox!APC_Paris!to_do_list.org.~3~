#+STARTUP: showall hidestars

* TODO

** LArSoft
   - Understand PD simulation file
   - Make sync between larsoft and data for CRT

** SuperCell
   - Finish Weiner-like filter. I can use the noise from run 99 (20220201). 
   - (w or w/o the filter) Make the convolution in each waveform
   - Apply filter to the fft in the waveform bases.

   - Update: actually Wiener filter is on the way. I need to check now about smaller waveforms. What if I fill with zeros? My solution was decreasing the FFT resolution. Let's see how it goes.. 

** Coldbox 
   - Confirmed that s.p.e. was correct

** Analog Readout
   - simulations of rise time was about 22 ns (questions about input)
   - measurements show

** Personal

*** Today 29/05 to do:

#+STARTUP: showall hidestars

* TODO
*** DONE Register to workshop
    - Send email to they and Beatrice
*** Tax stuff.. 
*** Practice TALK !!! 
*** 

** LArSoft
   - Understand PD simulation file
   - Make sync between larsoft and data for CRT

** SuperCell
   - Finish Weiner-like filter. I can use the noise from run 99 (20220201). 
   - (w or w/o the filter) Make the convolution in each waveform
   - Apply filter to the fft in the waveform bases.

   - Update: actually Wiener filter is on the way. I need to check now about smaller waveforms. What if I fill with zeros? My solution was decreasing the FFT resolution. Let's see how it goes.. 

   - note: noise spectrum analyzed without filter, resulting std dev = 6.7 


** Coldbox 
   - June data:
     + [ ] Signal from Ch3 and Ch4 (MiniArapuca A4ch1 and A1ch2) have a weird shape and noise is present.
     + [ ] Both cathode on and off showed this problem.
       + Example Run2 (off) 91 and 92
       + Example Run2 (on) 91 and 92
     + [ ] Ch3 example of high dark count: events 68, 69)
** Analog Readout
   - simulations of rise time was about 22 ns (questions about input)
   - measurements show

** Personal

** Linearity
  - Jean Pierre 

** CERN Mission

** Terminate FEEEEEEEE


*  Coldbox stuff[2/4] :
  SCHEDULED: <2022-06-13 Mon>
  + [-] Make a data acquisition plan:
    + [X] First test, verify if acquision is done as OR or AND
    + [X] Remember to check timestamp -> Set LED at a known frequency (if possible)
    + [X] Data with LED from 3 to 30 V
    + [X] Cosmic data taking, long statistic (check trigger how it works)
    + [ ] Any CRT data? For CRT, we need to change wavedump !
    + [ ] -> Talk with Bill: Decrease bias so we have no signal. Take noise run 
    + [X] Check if we need again to turn everything off again. 


  + [X] Wiener filter: check why there is two peaks (make small gaussian peaks)
    + It was the the align of the pulses
  + [X] Read article, send it to collab.
  + [ ] 

* Before travel:
  + Put videos on box
  + Check data from coldbox and LED
  + Check simulations stuff 
  + book hostels
